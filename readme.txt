cconvti v0.0

Description:

cconvti is a version of my earlier program convTI, but coded in C.
I'm mostly doing this as an opportunity to learn more about C and Makefiles.

cconvti converts .csv and text files into lists, matrices, variables, and programs for the TI-8x series of graphing calculators.

------------------------

Roadmap:

- make errors more descriptive (include row/col)
