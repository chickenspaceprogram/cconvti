cconvti v0.0
------------------------

Author: Athena Boose <pestpestthechicken@yahoo.com>

------------------------

Description:

cconvti is a version of my earlier program convTI, but coded in C.
I'm mostly doing this as an opportunity to learn more about how compilers work, and as such I'm not making use of things I probably should be making use of if I was sensible (specifically lex and yacc / flex and bison).

cconvti converts .csv and text files into lists, matrices, variables, and programs for the TI-8x series of graphing calculators.
In future, it may be able to execute program files and/or do some basic debugging.

------------------------

Roadmap:

- make errors more descriptive (include row/col)

Credits/Resources I used:

The book `Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools` by Aho, Sethi, and Ullman has so far proven to be quite helpful when implementing this project.
If you end up doing anything remotely similar, I can highly recommend checking it out.
